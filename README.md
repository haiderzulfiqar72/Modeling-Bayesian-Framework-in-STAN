# Modeling-Bayesian-Framework-in-STAN
Utilizing Bayesian Inference, this project analyzes crime data from the Chicago Police Department to estimate the difference in arrest rates between domestic and non-domestic crimes. It applies a Stan model to draw conclusions from the posterior distribution and validate the results, providing valuable insights into crime patterns and arrests.
